## Coding Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Variables and functions should use `camelCase`.
  - Classes should use `PascalCase`.
  - Constants should use `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces per indentation level (for JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.).
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex logic.
  - Function/method documentation should include a brief description of parameters and the return type.
  - Inline comments should be used sparingly and only to clarify non-obvious code.
- **Comment Wisely**: Avoid explaining every single line of code with a comment. Focus on explaining the purpose of functions and only comment on complex or non-obvious lines of code.

## Best Practices

### General Best Practices

- **Write Clean, Readable Code**: Always prioritize readability over cleverness. Code should be easily understood by other developers.
- **Avoid Hardcoding Values**: Use configuration files or environment variables where appropriate.
- **Modularize Code**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task. Break down larger functions into smaller, reusable ones.
- Use Arrow Functions: Prefer arrow functions for their simplicity and cleaner syntax.
- Use **async/await**: Opt for async/await over callbacks or .then() for better readability in asynchronous code.
- **Avoid Classes**: Prefer functions over classes unless absolutely necessary.
- Use modern es6 programming standards and formatting

## Style and Tone

- **Style**: Write in a clean, concise, and professional style. Avoid jargon where possible, but feel free to include technical terms when necessary.
- **Tone**: Keep the tone neutral and helpful. Do not use overly casual language, but also avoid being too formal. The goal is to create a friendly yet professional tone that can be easily understood by the target audience.

  **Examples**:

  - Too casual: "Hey there! Let's dive into how to write awesome code."
  - Too formal: "It is imperative that one follows the established conventions for optimal performance."
  - Ideal: "To maintain consistency across the project, we recommend following the established coding conventions."
