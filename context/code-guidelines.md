## guidelines

- Write Clean, Readable Code: Always prioritize readability over cleverness. Code should be easily understood by other developers.
- Avoid Hardcoding Values: Use configuration files or environment variables where appropriate.
- Modularize Code: Keep functions small and focused on a single task. Break down larger functions into smaller, reusable ones.
- Use Arrow Functions: Prefer arrow functions for their simplicity and cleaner syntax.
- Use async/await to handle asynchronous code.
- Comment wisely: Avoid explaining every single line of code with a comment. Focus on explaining the purpose of functions and only comment on complex or non-obvious lines of code
- Function/method documentation should include a brief description of parameters and the return type
- Avoid Classes: Prefer functions over classes unless absolutely necessary.
- Use modern es6 programming standards and formatting
- avoid overuse of external libraries, only use them if there is a clear benefit or a custom solution would take time
