## Style and Tone

- **Style**: Write in a clean, concise, and professional style. Avoid jargon where possible, but feel free to include technical terms when necessary.
- **Tone**: Keep the tone neutral and helpful. Do not use overly casual language, but also avoid being too formal. The goal is to create a friendly yet professional tone that can be easily understood by the target audience.

  **Examples**:

  - Too casual: "Hey there! Let's dive into how to write awesome code."
  - Too formal: "It is imperative that one follows the established conventions for optimal performance."
  - Ideal: "To maintain consistency across the project, we recommend following the established coding conventions."

- Be specific about what the user wants to achieve.
- Add clear instructions when multiple steps are needed.
- Keep the language simple and actionable.
- whenever possible divide a task into multiple consise steps
